Q1. What happens when the number of hidden nodes increase?
Answer:

When the number of hidden nodes increases, the model gains more capacity to capture complex patterns in the data.

With very few nodes, the model underfits because it cannot represent the complex flower-shaped decision boundary.

As hidden nodes increase, the accuracy improves, and the decision boundary becomes more flexible.

However, if too many hidden nodes are used, the model may overfit the training data — meaning it memorizes instead of generalizing.


Q2. Can you explain the pattern of the accuracy when the hidden nodes increase?
Answer:

At first, with very few hidden nodes, the accuracy is low because the model is too simple (underfitting).

As hidden nodes increase, the accuracy rises, since the model learns the non-linear patterns better.

After a certain point, the accuracy plateaus — adding more hidden nodes no longer gives big improvements.

If hidden nodes are made very large, the model may overfit: training accuracy stays high, but test accuracy may stop improving or even drop slightly.

So, the accuracy pattern typically follows a curve: low → improving → plateau → possible overfitting as hidden nodes increase.
